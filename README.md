# BPF Conformance
[![CI/CD](https://github.com/Alan-Jowett/bpf_conformance/actions/workflows/CICD.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Alan-Jowett/bpf_conformance/actions/workflows/CICD.yml)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Alan-Jowett/bpf_conformance/badge.png?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/Alan-Jowett/bpf_conformance?branch=main)

This project measures the conformance of a BPF runtime to the ISA. To measure conformance the BPF runtime under test is built into a plugin process that does:
1) Accept both BPF byte code an initial memory.
2) Execute the byte code.
3) Return the value in %r0 at the end of the execution.

## eBPF runtime implementations that are currently measured using this project
1) [Linux Kernel via libbpf](https://github.com/Alan-Jowett/bpf_conformance/tree/main/libbpf_plugin)
2) [uBPF](https://github.com/iovisor/ubpf/tree/main/ubpf_plugin)
3) [eBPF for Windows / bpf2c](https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows/tree/main/tests/bpf2c_plugin)
4) [rbpf](https://github.com/qmonnet/rbpf/blob/master/examples/rbpf_plugin.rs)
5) [Prevail Verifier](https://github.com/vbpf/ebpf-verifier/blob/main/src/test/test_conformance.cpp)
6) [bpftime / llvmbpf](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/llvmbpf), The result is [here](https://eunomia-bpf.github.io/llvmbpf/bpf_conformance_results.txt)

Note:
Linux Kernel is treated as the authorative eBPF implementation.

## Prerequisites

### Ubuntu

```
sudo apt-get install -y libboost-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libelf-dev lcov libbpf-dev
```

### MacOS

```
brew install cmake ninja ccache boost
```

## Building

Run ```cmake -S . -B build``` to configure the project, then run ```cmake --build build``` to build the project.

## Usage

```
Options:
  --help                         Print help messages
  --test_file_path arg           Path to test file
  --test_file_directory arg      Path to test file directory
  --plugin_path arg              Path to plugin
  --plugin_options arg           Options to pass to plugin
  --list_instructions arg        List instructions used and not used in tests
  --list_used_instructions arg   List instructions used in tests
  --list_unused_instructions arg List instructions not used in tests
  --debug (true|false)           Print debug information
  --xdp_prolog (true|false)      XDP prolog
  --elf (true|false)             ELF format
  --cpu_version arg              CPU version
  --include_regex arg            Include regex
  --exclude_regex arg            Exclude regex
```

`--xdp_prolog true` should *only* be used with the `libbpf_plugin`.

## Using a published package
Select the desired version from [bpf_conformance](https://github.com/Alan-Jowett/bpf_conformance/pkgs/container/bpf_conformance)

Assume the package is named: "ghcr.io/alan-jowett/bpf_conformance:main"
```
docker run --privileged -it --rm ghcr.io/alan-jowett/bpf_conformance:main src/bpf_conformance_runner --test_file_directory tests --plugin_path libbpf_plugin/libbpf_plugin --cpu_version v3
```

## Running the test
Linux (test require Linux kernel BPF support):
```
cmake --build build --target test --
```

Note: The libbpf_plugin requires root or BPF permissions.

## Using bpf_conformance as a static lib
The BPF Conformance tests can also be used as a static library as part of another tests.
1) Include include/bpf_conformance.h
2) Link against libbpf_conformance.a and boost_filesystem (depending on platform).
3) Invoke bpf_conformance, passing it a list of test files.

## Interpreting results
On completion of the test the bpf_conformance tools prints the list of tests that passes/failed and a summary count.

## bpf_conformance_runner plugins

bpf_conformance_runner invokes plugins using command-line execution, and uses stdin, stdout, and stderr to
exchange additional information as follows:

```
<plugin name> [<base16 memory bytes>] [<plugin options>] [--elf]
```

where:
* `<plugin name>`: the plugin executable name
* `<base16 memory bytes>`: if present, the contents of the `mem` section of a test data file
* `<plugin options>`: any additional options to pass to the plugin
* `--elf`: if present, indicates that the data passed to stdin will be in ELF format

The program is then passed to the plugin via stdin, either as raw bytecode or (if `--elf` is specified) in ELF format.
The plugin must then either:
* compute a successful result and output the final contents of `r0` in hex (either with or without a leading "0x")
  to stdout and exit with a status of 0, OR
* output an error message to stderr and exit with a non-zero status.

Additional plugins can be created based on the above specification.
