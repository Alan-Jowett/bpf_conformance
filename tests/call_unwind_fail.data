# Test call instruction with helper function 5 (unwind)
# Note: This test verifies the call instruction executes without crashing.
# The return value cannot be reliably tested because helper function behavior
# is implementation-specific. The unconditional mov after the call means
# the test passes if the instruction executes, regardless of helper behavior.
